### Redaction Modules
- Our library provides modular redaction functions to automatically mask or remove PII from text, images, and other data formats. These modules are customizable, allowing you to tailor the redaction process to meet the specific requirements of your application.

### Compliance Guidance
- PiiShield simplifies compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA. It offers a comprehensive set of guidelines, best practices, and pre-configured rules to ensure your application handles PII appropriately, minimizing the risk of data breaches and legal complications.

### Ease of Integration
- PiiShield is designed to seamlessly integrate into your existing machine learning workflows and applications. With straightforward APIs and clear documentation, you can easily incorporate PII detection and redaction capabilities into your projects without major code modifications.

### Constant Updates
- Our dedicated team of experts continually monitors and updates PiiShield to ensure it stays up-to-date with the latest privacy regulations and emerging best practices. You can rely on the library to evolve alongside the evolving landscape of data privacy.

## 👉🏻 Getting Started
To get started with PiiShield, follow these simple steps:

### Python
- In the python directory, run `poetry install && poetry shell`. 
- To run the redaction module, use `streamlit run <>`
- To run the evals, use `python eval.py`

### Prompts

In the prompts folder, the following contributions owuld be helpful:
-  Prompts using the name of the type of PII (i.e., Credit Card Number)
-  You can also add evals in the tests folder. This will help test coverage on PII data (even if the prompts don't exist yet).
